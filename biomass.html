    <h1>Biomass Energy</h1>
    <p>Biomass energy is the energy that is derived from organic materials such as plants, agricultural residues, and animal waste. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for various applications such as electricity generation, heating, and transportation fuels.</p>
    <p>Biomass can be converted into energy through various processes such as combustion, gasification, and anaerobic digestion. These processes release the stored chemical energy in biomass, which can then be used to generate electricity or produce biofuels.</p>
    <p>Biomass energy is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">How Biomass Energy Works</h2>
    <p>Biomass energy works by converting organic materials into energy through various processes. Combustion involves burning biomass to produce heat, which can be used to generate electricity. Gasification converts biomass into a gas that can be used to produce electricity or fuels. Anaerobic digestion breaks down organic materials in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas, which can be used for heating or electricity generation.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Benefits of Biomass Energy</h2>
    <p>There are many benefits to using biomass energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Decreasing dependence on fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Providing a renewable and sustainable source of energy</li>
        <li>Utilizing waste materials that would otherwise be discarded</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Challenges of Biomass Energy</h2>
    <p>Despite its many benefits, there are also some challenges associated with biomass energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Competition with food production for land and resources</li>
        <li>Potential environmental impact from biomass cultivation</li>
        <li>High costs for biomass processing and conversion technologies</li>
    </ul>
