    <h1>Biomass Energy</h1>
    <p>Biomass energy is the energy that is derived from organic materials such as plants, agricultural residues, and animal waste. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for various applications such as electricity generation, heating, and transportation fuels.</p>
    <p>Biomass can be converted into energy through various processes such as combustion, gasification, and anaerobic digestion. These processes release the stored chemical energy in biomass, which can then be used to generate electricity or produce biofuels.</p>
    <p>Biomass energy is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
