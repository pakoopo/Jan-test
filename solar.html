    <h1>Solar Energy</h1>
    <p>Solar energy is the energy that is harnessed from the sun. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for various applications such as electricity generation, heating, and desalination.</p>
    <p>Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, are used to convert sunlight into electricity. These panels are made up of many solar cells that contain a semiconductor material, usually silicon.</p>
    <p>Solar energy is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">How Solar Panels Work</h2>
    <p>Solar panels work by allowing photons, or particles of light, to knock electrons free from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. This process is known as the photovoltaic effect.</p>
    <p>Each solar cell consists of two layers of semiconductor material, one positively charged and one negatively charged. When sunlight hits the solar cell, it excites the electrons in the semiconductor material, creating an electric current.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Benefits of Solar Energy</h2>
    <p>There are many benefits to using solar energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Decreasing dependence on fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Lowering electricity bills</li>
        <li>Providing a renewable and sustainable source of energy</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Challenges of Solar Energy</h2>
    <p>Despite its many benefits, there are also some challenges associated with solar energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High initial costs for installation</li>
        <li>Intermittent energy production due to weather conditions</li>
        <li>Need for large areas to install solar panels</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Types of Solar Energy Systems</h2>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Photovoltaic Systems</h3>
        <p>Photovoltaic (PV) systems convert sunlight directly into electricity using solar cells. These systems can be installed on rooftops, ground-mounted, or integrated into building materials.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Solar Thermal Systems</h3>
        <p>Solar thermal systems use sunlight to produce heat, which can be used for water heating, space heating, or industrial processes. These systems often use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)</h3>
        <p>CSP systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a small area. The concentrated light is then used to produce heat, which drives a steam turbine connected to an electrical power generator.</p>
