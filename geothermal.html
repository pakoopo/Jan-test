    <h1>Geothermal Energy</h1>
    <p>Geothermal energy is the energy that is harnessed from the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for various applications such as electricity generation, heating, and cooling.</p>
    <p>Geothermal power plants use steam produced from reservoirs of hot water found a few miles or more below the Earth's surface to generate electricity. The steam rotates a turbine that activates a generator, producing electricity.</p>
    <p>Geothermal energy is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">How Geothermal Energy Works</h2>
    <p>Geothermal energy works by tapping into the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. This heat can be used to produce steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity. There are different types of geothermal power plants, including dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle plants, each with its own method of harnessing geothermal energy.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Types of Geothermal Power Plants</h2>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Dry Steam Plants</h3>
        <p>Dry steam plants use steam extracted from geothermal reservoirs to directly drive turbines and generate electricity. They are the oldest type of geothermal power plant.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Flash Steam Plants</h3>
        <p>Flash steam plants use high-pressure hot water from geothermal reservoirs. The pressure is reduced, causing the water to vaporize into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Binary Cycle Plants</h3>
        <p>Binary cycle plants use geothermal water to heat a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point. The secondary fluid vaporizes and drives turbines to generate electricity. This type of plant can operate at lower temperatures.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Benefits of Geothermal Energy</h2>
    <p>There are many benefits to using geothermal energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Decreasing dependence on fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Providing a renewable and sustainable source of energy</li>
        <li>Offering a reliable and consistent source of electricity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Challenges of Geothermal Energy</h2>
    <p>Despite its many benefits, there are also some challenges associated with geothermal energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High initial costs for drilling and plant construction</li>
        <li>Limited availability of suitable geothermal sites</li>
        <li>Potential environmental impact from drilling and plant operations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Geothermal Heating and Cooling</h2>
    <p>Geothermal energy can also be used for heating and cooling applications. Ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs) use the stable temperature of the ground to provide efficient heating and cooling for buildings. These systems can significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Future of Geothermal Energy</h2>
    <p>The future of geothermal energy looks promising with advancements in technology and increasing investments. Innovations such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), improved drilling techniques, and advanced heat exchangers are expected to enhance the efficiency and viability of geothermal energy.</p>
