    <h1>Geothermal Energy</h1>
    <p>Geothermal energy is the energy that is harnessed from the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for various applications such as electricity generation, heating, and cooling.</p>
    <p>Geothermal power plants use steam produced from reservoirs of hot water found a few miles or more below the Earth's surface to generate electricity. The steam rotates a turbine that activates a generator, producing electricity.</p>
    <p>Geothermal energy is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">How Geothermal Energy Works</h2>
    <p>Geothermal energy works by tapping into the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. This heat can be used to produce steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity. There are different types of geothermal power plants, including dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle plants, each with its own method of harnessing geothermal energy.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Benefits of Geothermal Energy</h2>
    <p>There are many benefits to using geothermal energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Decreasing dependence on fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Providing a renewable and sustainable source of energy</li>
        <li>Offering a reliable and consistent source of electricity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Challenges of Geothermal Energy</h2>
    <p>Despite its many benefits, there are also some challenges associated with geothermal energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High initial costs for drilling and plant construction</li>
        <li>Limited availability of suitable geothermal sites</li>
        <li>Potential environmental impact from drilling and plant operations</li>
    </ul>
