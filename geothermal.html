    <h1>Geothermal Energy</h1>
    <p>Geothermal energy is the energy that is harnessed from the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for various applications such as electricity generation, heating, and cooling.</p>
    <p>Geothermal power plants use steam produced from reservoirs of hot water found a few miles or more below the Earth's surface to generate electricity. The steam rotates a turbine that activates a generator, producing electricity.</p>
    <p>Geothermal energy is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
