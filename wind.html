    <h1>Wind Energy</h1>
    <p>Wind energy is the energy that is harnessed from the wind. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for electricity generation.</p>
    <p>Wind turbines are used to convert the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical power, which is then converted into electricity. Wind farms, which consist of multiple wind turbines, are often used to generate large amounts of electricity.</p>
    <p>Wind energy is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">How Wind Turbines Work</h2>
    <p>Wind turbines work by capturing the kinetic energy of the wind and converting it into mechanical power. This mechanical power is then converted into electricity by a generator.</p>
    <p>Each wind turbine consists of a rotor with blades, a nacelle that houses the generator, and a tower. When the wind blows, it causes the rotor to spin, which in turn spins the generator to produce electricity.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Benefits of Wind Energy</h2>
    <p>There are many benefits to using wind energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Decreasing dependence on fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Providing a renewable and sustainable source of energy</li>
        <li>Creating jobs in the wind energy industry</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Challenges of Wind Energy</h2>
    <p>Despite its many benefits, there are also some challenges associated with wind energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intermittent energy production due to weather conditions</li>
        <li>Noise and visual impact of wind turbines</li>
        <li>Potential impact on wildlife, such as birds and bats</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Types of Wind Turbines</h2>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT)</h3>
        <p>HAWTs are the most common type of wind turbine. They have blades that rotate around a horizontal axis and are typically used in large wind farms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT)</h3>
        <p>VAWTs have blades that rotate around a vertical axis. They are less common than HAWTs but can be used in urban environments where wind directions are variable.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="section-title">Wind Energy Applications</h2>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Onshore Wind Farms</h3>
        <p>Onshore wind farms are located on land and are the most common type of wind energy installation. They can be found in rural areas, on hills, and along coastlines.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Offshore Wind Farms</h3>
        <p>Offshore wind farms are located in bodies of water, usually on the continental shelf. They benefit from stronger and more consistent winds compared to onshore wind farms.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="section-title">Future of Wind Energy</h2>
    <p>The future of wind energy looks promising with advancements in technology and increasing investments. Innovations such as floating wind turbines and improved energy storage solutions are expected to enhance the efficiency and viability of wind energy.</p>
