    <h1>Wind Energy</h1>
    <p>Wind energy is the energy that is harnessed from the wind. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for electricity generation.</p>
    <p>Wind turbines are used to convert the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical power, which is then converted into electricity. Wind farms, which consist of multiple wind turbines, are often used to generate large amounts of electricity.</p>
    <p>Wind energy is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
