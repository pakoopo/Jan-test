    <h1>Wind Energy</h1>
    <p>Wind energy is the energy that is harnessed from the wind. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for electricity generation.</p>
    <p>Wind turbines are used to convert the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical power, which is then converted into electricity. Wind farms, which consist of multiple wind turbines, are often used to generate large amounts of electricity.</p>
    <p>Wind energy is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">How Wind Turbines Work</h2>
    <p>Wind turbines work by capturing the kinetic energy of the wind and converting it into mechanical power. This mechanical power is then converted into electricity by a generator.</p>
    <p>Each wind turbine consists of a rotor with blades, a nacelle that houses the generator, and a tower. When the wind blows, it causes the rotor to spin, which in turn spins the generator to produce electricity.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Benefits of Wind Energy</h2>
    <p>There are many benefits to using wind energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Decreasing dependence on fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Providing a renewable and sustainable source of energy</li>
        <li>Creating jobs in the wind energy industry</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Challenges of Wind Energy</h2>
    <p>Despite its many benefits, there are also some challenges associated with wind energy, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intermittent energy production due to weather conditions</li>
        <li>Noise and visual impact of wind turbines</li>
        <li>Potential impact on wildlife, such as birds and bats</li>
    </ul>
