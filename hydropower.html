    <h1>Hydropower</h1>
    <p>Hydropower, also known as hydroelectric power, is the energy that is harnessed from moving water. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for electricity generation.</p>
    <p>Hydropower plants use dams to store water in a reservoir. When the water is released, it flows through turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of the water into mechanical power. This mechanical power is then converted into electricity.</p>
    <p>Hydropower is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
