    <h1>Hydropower</h1>
    <p>Hydropower, also known as hydroelectric power, is the energy that is harnessed from moving water. It is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used for electricity generation.</p>
    <p>Hydropower plants use dams to store water in a reservoir. When the water is released, it flows through turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of the water into mechanical power. This mechanical power is then converted into electricity.</p>
    <p>Hydropower is a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">How Hydropower Plants Work</h2>
    <p>Hydropower plants work by using the potential energy stored in water to generate electricity. When water is released from the reservoir, it flows through turbines, which spin to generate mechanical power. This mechanical power is then converted into electricity by a generator.</p>
    <p>There are different types of hydropower plants, including run-of-the-river, storage, and pumped storage plants. Each type has its own method of harnessing the energy from moving water.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Benefits of Hydropower</h2>
    <p>There are many benefits to using hydropower, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Decreasing dependence on fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Providing a renewable and sustainable source of energy</li>
        <li>Offering a reliable and consistent source of electricity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Challenges of Hydropower</h2>
    <p>Despite its many benefits, there are also some challenges associated with hydropower, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Environmental impact on aquatic ecosystems</li>
        <li>Displacement of communities due to dam construction</li>
        <li>High initial costs for building dams and infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Types of Hydropower Plants</h2>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Run-of-the-River</h3>
        <p>Run-of-the-river hydropower plants generate electricity by using the natural flow of a river. They have minimal storage capacity and rely on the river's flow to generate power.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>Storage hydropower plants use dams to store water in a reservoir. The stored water is released to generate electricity when needed, providing a reliable and consistent source of power.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Pumped Storage</h3>
        <p>Pumped storage hydropower plants store energy by pumping water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir during periods of low electricity demand. The stored water is then released to generate electricity during peak demand periods.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="section-title">Environmental Impact</h2>
    <p>While hydropower is a clean and renewable energy source, it can have significant environmental impacts. These include habitat disruption, changes in water quality, and the displacement of communities. Mitigation measures are often implemented to minimize these impacts.</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">Hydropower Innovations</h2>
    <p>Innovations in hydropower technology are focused on improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact. These include the development of fish-friendly turbines, small-scale hydropower systems, and advanced monitoring and control systems.</p>
